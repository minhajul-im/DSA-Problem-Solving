/**
 * What is greedy algorithm?
 * A greedy algorithm is a problem-solving approach that makes locally
 * optimal choices at each step with the aim of finding a global optimum
 * or a satisfactory solution. In a greedy algorithm, decisions are made
 * based on the best available option at the current step, without
 * considering the potential long-term consequences or examining all
 * possible choices. The algorithm iteratively builds a solution by
 * selecting the most favorable option at each stage, under the assumption
 * that these choices will lead to an overall optimal outcome. However,
 * the correctness of a greedy algorithm depends on whether the chosen
 * locally optimal choices consistently result in a globally optimal
 * solution for the given problem.
