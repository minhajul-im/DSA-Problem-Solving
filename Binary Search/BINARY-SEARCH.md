==>What is Binary Search?
Binary Search Algorithm is one of the widely used searching algorithms. It can be used to sort arrays. This searching technique follows the divide and conquer strategy. The search space always reduces to half in every iteration.

==> Why is it called binary search?
Binary search is a 'divide and conquer' algorithm which requires the initial array to be sorted before searching. It is called binary because it splits the array into two halves as part of the algorithm.

Initially, a binary search will look at the item in the middle of the array and compare it to the search terms.

==> Why need binary search?
Binary search is a search algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array. It is a fast and efficient way of searching through a large collection of data to locate a specific value.

The main advantage of binary search is that it has a time complexity of O(log n), which means that it can quickly search through very large datasets. This is in contrast to linear search, which has a time complexity of O(n), meaning it becomes slower as the size of the dataset increases.

Binary search is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets that are sorted in ascending or descending order. It is commonly used in computer science and programming, especially when dealing with databases, search engines, and other applications that require searching through large amounts of data.

Overall, binary search is an important search algorithm in computer science and programming, providing a fast and efficient way of searching through sorted data.
