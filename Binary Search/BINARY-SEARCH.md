------------------------------------ Binary Search---------------------------------

==>What is Binary Search?
Binary Search Algorithm is one of the widely used searching algorithms. It can be used to sort arrays. This searching technique follows the divide and conquer strategy. The search space always reduces to half in every iteration.

==> Why is it called binary search?
Binary search is a 'divide and conquer' algorithm which requires the initial array to be sorted before searching. It is called binary because it splits the array into two halves as part of the algorithm.

Initially, a binary search will look at the item in the middle of the array and compare it to the search terms.
