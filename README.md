# DSA (Data Structure & Algorithms)

We will explore data structure & algorithm.

What is "DSA"?
"DSA" means Data Structure & Algorithm.
Data Structure is the way to store & organize data.
Algorithm means steps taken to make a decision.

Why need data structure and algorithm?
We need to provide an efficient way to find and solve a problem.

Data Structure: The contacts list in your phone is a data structure that organizes your contacts in a way that makes them easy to find and use. This list might be organized alphabetically, by first name or last name, or by other criteria, making it easy for you to find and contact the person you need.

Algorithm: For example, when you search for a contact by name, your phone's software likely uses an algorithm to search through the contacts list and find the contact you're looking for. Similarly, when you add or delete a contact from the list, your phone's software may use algorithms to update the list and ensure that it remains organized and easily searchable. So while the primary function of the Contacts list on your phone is to store and organize data, there is some algorithmic processing involved in managing and manipulating that data as well.
