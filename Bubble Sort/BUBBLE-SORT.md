------------------------------------ Bubble Sort------------------------------------

==> What is Bubble Sort?
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets.

==> How does work?
Bubble Sort works by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements in the list and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm makes multiple passes through the list, and in each pass, it moves the largest (or smallest, depending on the desired order) element to its correct position in the sorted list.
