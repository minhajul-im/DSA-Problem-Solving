------------------------------------ Linear Search---------------------------------

==> What is Liner Search?
Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise, the search continues till the end of the data collection.

==> Why need Linear Search Algorithm?
Linear search algorithm is useful in situations where we need to find a particular element in a list or array and we do not have any information about the order or structure of the list. It is a simple algorithm that is easy to implement, and it can be used with any type of list, including unsorted lists.

While linear search algorithm is not the most efficient search algorithm, it can still be useful for small lists or arrays. In addition, linear search algorithm can be used as a basis for more complex search algorithms, such as binary search, which is more efficient for sorted lists.

Overall, linear search algorithm is a fundamental algorithm in computer science and is often taught as one of the first search algorithms, making it an important concept to understand for beginners.
